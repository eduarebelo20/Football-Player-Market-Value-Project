# Football-Player-Market-Value-Project

In this project I will use web scraping methods to retrieve information from https://www.footballbenchmark.com/data_analytics, to be able to do a study to find out which football players in their database might be overpriced or underpriced using my own custom methods.
After that, I will study the dataset and run some queries and statistical tests, in order to answer some questions that I consider that have relevance to this topic.
